    <em>Wake Attacked by a Shadowy Murderer</em>
    The man turned to face me. His face was covered in shadows. It was hard to make him out in the darkness of the forest that surrounded us, but the axe he lifted was plain to see. It glistened with the blood of his victim. He grinned madly. The shadows were alive, distorting his features.It was a scene from a nightmare, but I was awake.

    <em>Wake Fights a Taken with light</em>
    The taken stood before me. It was impossible to focus on it, as if it stood in ablind spot caused by a brain tumor or an eye disease. It was bleeding shadows like ink underwater, like a cloud of blood from a shark bite. I was terrified. Isqueezed the flashlight like my life depended on it, willing it to stop it coming any closer. Suddenly, something gave, and the light seemed to shine brighter.

    <em>The Dark Presence Wakes Up</em>
    For a long time, the Dark Presence had been weak, sleeping, nothing but a half-forgotten nightmare or a shadowy flicker in the corner of an eye in the forest atnight; not real enough to properly exist, and yet too evocative to fade away completely.Now it was waking up, the writer like a fly caught in a spider's web, each jerkand kick vibrating the strands that led deep into its lair. It was aware of himnow, and it could use him.All he'd need was a little incentive.

    <em>Wake Attacked by Birds</em>
    I heard them before I saw them, swooping down from the sky and screeching as they came.I spun around just as the cloud was upon me. For an instant, I stared into a hundred dead eyes, black pearls glittering in the darkness.I raised the flashlight and the swarm exploded like fireworks. Feathers burned,turned into ash. I couldn't hear my scream above theirs.

    <em>Wake Finds Pages</em>
    At first I kept finding the 
    pages as if by accident. The book I couldn't remember was either a terrible and true prophecy, or an act of creation that had rewritten the world. I began to hunt the 
    pages, feverishly, for they held the answer to the mystery.With it I could save myself.With it I could save Alice.

    <em>TV in the Gas Station</em>
    I stepped into the gas station's garage. It was dark and quiet. The place was amess. It looked like someone trashed the place, or that there'd been some kind of fight. Light spilled into the room through an open door at the back, and I made my way toward it.Without any warning, I was blinded by a bright light. An old portable TV on theshelf had come alive by itself. Impossibly, I could see myself on the screen, talking like a madman.

    <em>Wake Lies to the Sheriff</em>
    "The cabin on Cauldron Lake?" she asked.The Sheriff looked at me suspiciously. The early morning light flooded through the office windows. I would probably never have gotten out of the woods alive without her help, but I couldn't tell her the truth of what I'd faced the previousnight. She'd think I was lying, or crazy. She'd lock me up. And she wouldn't help me find Alice.
